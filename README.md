My Project is going to be a batlle set in the Star Wars world. It is going to start with a close up of the death star and then a transport ship will come into scene. The Empire will then start to attack the transport ship with TIE Fighters. The rebels will then turn up and start to fight the Empire

Update:
Description: This a small scale repersentation of the rebellion destroying the Death Star in the original Star Wasrs triliogy. I also took audio clips from various different Star Wars movies and shows to add to the story.

Instructions/How it works: You controll the X-Wing movement using W,A,S,D with shift to move faster and the mouse co-ordinate is the direction that you are looking in. The Tie Fighters will move in a straight line until they are in range of you then they will begin to chase you you must destroy them by sooting them which is left click on your mouse, these ties only need to be shot 2 times. The ties move quickly so it doesnt take long for them to reach you. After that there are two star destroyers which move slowly and will change their rotation to look at you. The star destroyers need to be shot 5 times before they are destroyed, and then you move onto the Death Star. The Death Star needs to be shot 10 times. All lasers have a range so you will have to get close to each ship to destroy it.

What I'm most proud of: Honestly I'm proud of everything the progress in coding, how the final version came out and what ive learned in unity. I really enjoyed this assignment, more than I thought I would and I'm considering doing more in my spare time. The only thing that I'm not happy with is the scale i really wanted to have more of each ship but unfortunatly my laptop couldn't handle much more.
